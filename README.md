# HireTruck-SSIP-Hackathon-project
HireTruck is a Web Application which helps carriers and shippers to bid on the basis of posted Ads. Created by RSU B.tech CSE with specialisation in Cyber Security students team.

  This Web Application project uses PHP for front-end development and MySQL for Back-End development which is well known for providing an easier GUI based interface for users who are not that familiar with using computers.
  For designing the portal, we have used HTML-5 and CSS-3.
